# Task 15: DVWA SQL Injection Labs Overview
This repository contains a report and supporting files for Task 15, focusing on identifying and exploiting SQL Injection vulnerabilities in the Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA) across different security levels: Low, Medium, and High.

The goal of this task was to demonstrate how SQL Injection attacks can be carried out and to evaluate how the security measures implemented at each level impact the complexity of the exploitation process. This exercise underscores the critical importance of protecting web applications against common vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection.
